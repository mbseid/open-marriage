    <h2>BWI</h2>

        Easton and Saint Michaels are rural towns on Marylandâ€™s Eastern Shore. The best airport to fly into is <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?q=Baltimore/Washington+International+Airport"><b>Baltimore/Washington International (BWI)</b></a>. The drive from BWI to Easton, MD is a little over one hour (60 miles). In order to get between hotels and the wedding venue a car is necessary.
